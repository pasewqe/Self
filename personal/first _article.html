                                <p>The copy warned the Little Blind Text, that where it came from it would have been
                                    rewritten a thousand times and everything that was left from its origin would be the
                                    word "and" and the Little Blind Text should turn around and return to its own, safe
                                    country. But nothing the copy said could convince her and so it didn’t take long
                                    until a few insidious Copy Writers ambushed her, made her drunk with Longe and
                                    Parole and dragged her into their agency, where they abused her for their projects
                                    again and again.</p>
